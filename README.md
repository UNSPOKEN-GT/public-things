I gratefully beseech that should you deign to employ my complete oeuvres,
you graciously proffer rightful accolades to my lowly being.

Nevertheless, if you garner naught but celestial inspiration from my scribblings,
I hold no perturbation regarding acknowledgment. ðŸ‘½


in other words:


please credit me if you're going to use one of my scripts fully,
however, if its to simply gain inspiration, then I don't really mind
if you include me in your credits
