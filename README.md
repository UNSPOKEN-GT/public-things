**BEFORE CHECKING THE SHORTCUT V2 PREMIUM LEAK, READ THIS CAREFULLY**

1.  This file was made in order to protect those who execute it before checking the source
2.  All I did was check every singular loadstring in the script & disable them by malforming
3.  If you want to check for them, simply CTRL + F -> loadstring

/ CODE FOR SAFETY

- insanely safe ngl == it's legit safe as fuck, althought they might change it to something bad
- fairly safe ngl == execute it at ur own risk
- disabled so they don't change it into an ip logger == don't want them doing that lmfao
- disabled cause it's newly edited == extremely fucking high chance
- possible ip logger == high chance it's an ip logger (reccommended to not execute)
- THESE ARE LITERAL IP LOGGERS! == bro don't execute lmfao
- 404 error :skull: (not found) == invalid site LMFAO
- something new to me == never saw this site/script link before (idk)
- infinite yield == self explanotarysh
- possibly skidded == possibilty that this is skidded lol
- a literal eyesore, pls help == code that looks like horse shit (idk much)
